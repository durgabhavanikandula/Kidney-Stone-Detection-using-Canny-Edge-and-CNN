Kidney-Stone-Detection-using-Canny-Edge-and-CNN
The project combines two powerful techniques: Canny edge detection and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to automatically identify and localize kidney stones in medical images, such as ultrasound images.
Picture processing is a method of performing operations on a picture in order to improve it or extract relevant information from it. Because kidney stones have low contrast and speckle noise, finding them via ultrasound imaging is a very difficult task. The solution to this problem is to use the right image processing methods. In order to identify precise and accurate items from ultrasound pictures, image processing relies on object detection. The size and dimensions of a kidney stone aid in its identification using the CNN and Canny Edge algorithms. The ultrasound image is initially pre-processed to remove speckle noise, which includes canny edge detection, and CNN is applied in order to know the presence of stones. Then the desired image is segmented to change the representation so that it is something that is more meaningful and easier to analyze. Then objects are detected in the segmented image, and by giving a threshold value the presence of stone is detected and marked along with its dimensions.
